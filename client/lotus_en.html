	<h1 align="center"><b>Lotus</b></h1>
	<h3 align="center">A classic, tactical game</h3>
	<h2>Object of the game</h2>
	<p>
		The first to stragically move all their game pieces to the finish is the
		winner.
	</p>
	<h2>Before you begin</h2>
	<p>
		On player is given 10 white and the other 10 black pieces. Stack the
		pieces of the same color in the middle of the game board in the
		following manner:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>one stack with 4 pieces</li>
		<li>one stack with 3 pieces</li>
		<li>one stack with 2 pieces</li>
		<li>one stack with 1 piece</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Playing the game</h2>
	<p>
		Decide who goes first an the take turn moving your pieces (for times when
		you cannot move, see section <em>No possible moves</em>).
	</p>
	<p>
		You can only move a piece that is on top of a stack or that is the only
		piece that is left in this stack. The height of the stack determines how
		far you can move your piece. That is, you can only move your piece as
		many squares as there are pieces in the stack. Therefore:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a piece in a stack with only one piece can be moved one square</li>
		<li>a piece in a stack with two pieces can be moved 2 squares</li>
		<li>a piece in a stack with three pieces can be moved 3 squares</li>
		<li>etc.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Move your pieces forward along the squares on the board. There are two
		start squares (marked with a <em>L</em> and a <em>R</em>) but only one
		exit square (the third end of the map). You cannot move pieces
		backwards.
	</p>
	<p>
		On your turn, you can stack any of your colored pieces on top of any
		other single piece or existing stack. After the game starts there is no
		limit to the number of pieces in a stack.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can move any of your pieces forward, even if you still have pieces
		in the start square.
	</p>
	<h2>No possible moves</h2>
	<p>
		If you have no piece of your color that is on top of stack or by itself
		on a square, you cannot move one of your pieces. You must skip your turn
		and wait until one of your pieces is free to move.
	</p>
	<h2>Finish</h2>
	<p>
		The finish is <strong>after</strong> the last square on the board. You
		do not have to land exactly on it to take you piece out of the game. If
		you have moved a piece into the finish, take it off the board, out of
		play.
	</p>
	<h2>End of the game</h2>
	<p>
		The game is over when a player moves all his or her pieces past the
		finish.
