	<h3 align="center">Playing <em>Lotus</em> under Linux</h3>
	<h2>Laws of the game</h2>
	<p>
		You can read the laws of the game under <em>Help/How to play Lotus</em>.
	</p>
	<h2>Game type</h2>
	<p>
		On the one hand you can play toghether with a friend on one Computer
		(<em>Local match</em>). On the other hand you can play with other people
		via network (<em>Network game</em>).
	</p>
	<p>
		A mode which allows to play against the computer is still in development.
	</p>
	<h2>How to start a new game</h2>
	<p>
		First you have to choose a game type in the <em>Options</em> menu.
		Following you need to select <em>New game</em> in the <em>Game</em> menu.
		If you have chosen a <em>Network match</em> it may happen that you have
		to wait for an opponent.
	</p>
	<h2>How to move the pieces</h2>
	<p>
		If you have chosen a stack and want to move the piece on its top, you
		just need to click on this stack. But you cannot move a stone of your
		opponent.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to move a piece from the start square there may appear a
		dialog that asks you where you want to insert it. If you decide for
		left it is put on the left part of the map (marked with a <em>L</em>)
		else it is put on the right part (<em>R</em>).
	</p>
	<p>
		If you cannot survey the whole board because the stacks overlay you
		have the possibility to rotate it. This may happen via the mouse
		(just hold the left button pressed and move the mouse) or the
		arrow keys.
	</p>
	<h2>The local match</h2>
	<p>
		If you have decided in favour of a local match the owner of the black
		pieces may do the first move. After that the game goes as described in
		the laws of the game. (In the status bar is always a hint whose turn
		it is.)
	</p>
	<h2>Das Netzwerkspiel</h2>
	<p>
		After a network match was started the application tries to connect to
		the server. If their occur any errors it stops with an error message.
		If the connection to the server was established the match can almost
		start. You just have to wait for a second player.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now the server exchanges the names of the players and tells them the
		colour of their pieces. The one with black pieces has to start the
		game. (In the status bar is alway a hint whose turn it is.)
	</p>
	<h2>Settings</h2>
	<p>
		Over the item <em>Settings...</em> in the <em>Options</em> menu you
		have the possibility to configure your program.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, you can choose the language of your application. But changes
		are only applied after a restart.
	</p>
	<p>
		Moreover, you have the chance to change the search path of the
		application. Normally it should point to the directory where the
		translation and help files are stored (in the subdirectories
		<em>lang</em> and <em>help</em>, respectively). If you have installed
		the program in the usual way you do not need to change anything.
		But if you installed it in an extraordinary way, for instance in your
		home directory, this may be very helpful.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the tab window <em>Identity</em> you can tell the program your name
		and your e-mail adress. They are send to your opponent during each
		network game.
	</p>
	<p>
		The tab window <em>Server</em> allows you to make various settings
		concerning the server for your network games. You can choose the
		host and the port, where <em>5180</em> is the default port.
	</p>
	<h2>Where can I play Lotus in the internet?</h2>
	<p>
		Usually there is running a server at <em>lotux.homelinux.org</em> from
		6 am till 10 pm (CET). Furthermore there is a list with other servers
		on <em>http://lotux.homelinux.org/</em>.
	</p>
