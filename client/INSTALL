Special system requirements:
----------------------------

To build the program you need Qt 3.x and OpenGL. If they are not present on
your system, they can be downloaded at "http://www.trolltech.com/" and
"http://www.mesa3d.org/", respectively.


Installation guide:
-------------------

After unpacking the source distribution with a command like

	tar --gzip xvf lotux-<version>.tgz

type

	cd lotux-<version>/

to change into the source directory. Now run

	./configure

to create some configuartion files and the Makefile. If your header files
or libraries for Qt3, OpenGL or X11 are not placed in the usual directories,
try the `--help' option, to find out, how you can tell this configure.
After everything is configured, run

	make

to build the application. If you also wish to install the software, just type

	make install

If you decide against an installation, some changes to lotux's configuration
are neccesary. You need to specifie the right search path for the translation
and the help files in the settingsdialog. Usually, this path is the
source directory.


Running lotux:
--------------

After a successfull installation just run

	lotux

and the program will start. Consider its online help for further details.
