Special system requirements:
----------------------------

To build the server you need the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). You can
download it from "http://www.haskell.org/ghc/"-


Installation guide:
-------------------

After unpacking the source distribution with a command like

	tar --gzip xvf lotusserver-<version>.tgz

type

	cd lotusserver-<version>/

to change into the source directory. Now run

	./configure

to create some configuartion files and the Makefile. If your header files
or libraries for Qt3, OpenGL or X11 are not placed in the usual directories,
try the `--help' option, to find out, how you can tell this configure.
After everything is configured, run

	make

to build the application. If you also wish to install the software, just type

	make install


Running lotusserver:
--------------

After a successfull installation just run

	lotusserver

and the server will start. Consider the command line option `--help' for
further information.
